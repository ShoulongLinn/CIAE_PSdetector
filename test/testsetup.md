# How to test boards
## Test setup
1. use signal generator to generate a square wave
2. connect the signal generator to the capacitor board(test board)then you get a charge source at edge of the square wave notice that is dual direction rising edge and falling edge generate positive and negative charge
3. Q = C * V, now you get your charge source
4. connect the charge source to the board you want to test(amp board, amp and comparator board,etc)
5.  record the output of the board you want to test and compare it with the simulation result
